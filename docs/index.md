title: Welcome to Adapt

<!-- DOCTOC SKIP -->

Adapt is the easiest way to reliably and repeatably deploy your apps anywhere -- to your laptop, a Kubernetes cluster, your favorite cloud, or anywhere else. Adapt specifications look like [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) apps, but instead of rendering browser DOM elements like input, or div, Adapt specifications render to DOM elements like AWS EC2 instances, Lambdas, Kubernetes Pods, or any other building block for your application architecture.  If you are already familiar with React, many of the concepts will look familiar. If not, don't worry, knowledge of React isn't required to start using Adapt.

## Getting Started
For a new project, you can get started without knowing much about Adapt by using a starter.  The [Getting Started Guide](https://adaptjs.org/docs/getting_started) will walk through installing Adapt and deploying a starter project.
```bash
# Create a new project from a starter
adapt new <starter> <project directory>
# Create a new deployment of the starter project
adapt run --deployID <myID>
# Write some code
  ...
# Update the running deployment
adapt update <myID>
```

Deploy a sample application with a [React](https://reactjs.org) front-end, a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) API server, and a [Postgres](https://postgresql.org) database, along with a static file server and a URL router:

<div class="term term-demo center-block">
    <div class="term-header">
        <button class="term-header-button term-header-button-close"></button>
        <button class="term-header-button term-header-button-minimize"></button>
        <button class="term-header-button term-header-button-expand"></button>
        <div class="term-header-title">
            <span>Unbounded Adapt</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="term-content">
        <!-- NOTE: Workaround for docusaurus not re-writing URLs in HTML blocks
          -- is to use an absolute path, but this will always be the "next"
          -- version of the image.
          -->

    </div>
</div>


A snippet of the corresponding Adapt specification that the starter sets up for this example:
```jsx
import { UrlRouter } from "@adpt/cloud/http";
import { NodeService, ReactApp } from "@adpt/cloud/nodejs";
import { Postgres } from "@adpt/cloud/postgres";
import Adapt, { Group, handle } from "@adpt/core";
import { k8sStyle } from "./styles";

function App() {
    const pg = handle();
    const app = handle();
    const api = handle();

    return <Group>

        <UrlRouter
            port={8080}
            routes={[
                { path: "/api/", endpoint: api },
                { path: "/", endpoint: app }
            ]} />

        <ReactApp handle={app} srcDir="../frontend" />

        <NodeService handle={api} srcDir="../backend" connectTo={pg} />

        <Postgres handle={pg} />

    </Group>;
}

Adapt.stack("default", <App />, k8sStyle);
```
